# Three.js Game Project

This project is a learning platform for JavaScript and Three.js, focusing on key game development aspects such as terrain generation, user registration and login with JWT authentication, and building with a user interface (UI). It provides a foundation for understanding and creating interactive 3D environments.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- To provide hands-on experience with JavaScript and Three.js.
- To understand the basics of terrain generation.
- To implement user registration and login functionality using JWT authentication.
- To create a building system with an interactive UI.

## Features

- **Terrain Generation**: Procedural generation of terrain using Three.js.
- **User Registration and Login**: Secure user authentication and account management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Building System**: Interface to construct and manage buildings within the game world.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vytur/three.js-website.git
   cd three.js-website
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
  Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. **Run the Project**
  Start the server and the client concurrently by running:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

4. **Access the game**
   Access the local endpoint where the client is hosted, ex. ->
   ```bash
   [1] 
   [1]   VITE v5.3.1  ready in 163 ms
   [1]
   [1]   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   [1]   ➜  Network: use --host to expose
   ```

This `README.md` provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to set it up locally, and highlights the learning objectives specific to terrain generation, JWT authentication, and building with a UI.
